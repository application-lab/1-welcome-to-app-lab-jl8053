# About Me

Hi! My name is Janice and I'm from Queens New York. I am a senior majoring in Business and Marketing. I spent my junior year "studying away" in New York City, where I was able to pick up a minor in Psychology. I was also able to take advantage of the variety of course selections, such as American Sign Language and Creative Arts Therapy. 

## Hobbies and Interests
In my free time, I like to listen to music, dance, and paint. I've always loved the different art forms. I also enjoy fitness and love staying active. While I was in New York the past year, I decided to try kickboxing. It has become a new hobby of mine and I intend to continue that here in Shanghai. 
I am extremely interested in environmental sustainability and social impact. As a Business major, I believe that environmental efforts made by corporations can make an immense impact on our planet. When I interned at IBM this summer, I was able to see how technology, such as Blockchain and AI, play a big part in that movement. 

## Fun Facts
1. Most of my peers know me as a *crazy dog lady* as most of my social media posts are dogs.
2. I might be one of the very few people who actually enjoys durian and thinks it smells pretty appetizing.
3. I can't roll my R's. I've tried for the past decade and have not yet succeeded.
